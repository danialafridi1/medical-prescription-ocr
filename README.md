# Medical Prescription OCR

This project aims to develop an OCR system for medical prescriptions.

## Project Structure

- **preprocessing**: Contains scripts and tools for preprocessing the images before OCR.
- **models**: Includes the machine learning models used for OCR.
- **data**: Directory for storing datasets used in the project.
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and analysis.
- **scripts**: Additional scripts for various tasks related to the project.

## Getting Started

1. **Preprocessing**: 
    - Navigate to the `preprocessing` folder to find scripts for image preprocessing.
    - Run the preprocessing scripts to prepare your images for OCR.

2. **Training Models**:
    - Go to the `models` directory to access and train the OCR models.
    - Follow the instructions in the respective model folders to train and evaluate the models.

3. **Data**:
    - Store your datasets in the `data` folder.
    - Ensure the data is organized as required by the preprocessing and model scripts.

4. **Notebooks**:
    - Use the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` folder for experimentation and analysis.
    - These notebooks provide insights and visualizations for the OCR process.

5. **Scripts**:
    - Additional scripts for various tasks can be found in the `scripts` folder.
    - Refer to the documentation within each script for usage instructions.
